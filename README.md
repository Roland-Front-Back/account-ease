## 📖 Overview

**Account-Ease** is a frontend-only web application designed to simulate accounting journal entry tasks using intuitive, natural language input. Just type sentences like:

> “Paid ₱1,000 for rent” or “Received ₱5,000 from clients”

And watch them get parsed into accurate double-entry accounting logs.

No backend. No login. Just fast, local journalizing.
